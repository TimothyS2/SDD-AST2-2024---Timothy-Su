This is just the code for if you are unable to access it on repl.it
<br>

To start, open and run the index.html file. You should then be able to interact with the program
<br>
The program contains functions to perform both a bubble sort and a binary search on an array of numerical values.
<br>
To change the contents of the array, open the script.js file and change the variable simArray1.
<br>
<br>
To perform the binary search, the array must be sorted in ascending order
<br>
Search queries can only be numerical values
<br>
Data types other than integers or floats in the array will cause the algorithms to function unexpectedly or break.
