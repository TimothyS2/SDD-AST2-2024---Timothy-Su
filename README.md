This is just the code for if you are unable to access it on repl.it

To start, open and run the index.html file. You should then be able to interact with the program
The program contains functions to perform both a bubble sort and a binary search on an array of numerical values.
To change the contents of the array, open the script.js file and change the variable simArray1.

To perform the binary search, the array must be sorted in ascending order
Search queries can only be numerical values
Data types other than integers or floats in the array will cause the algorithms to function unexpectedly or break.
